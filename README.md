		The goal of the app is to facilitate the analysis of the last matches of the members of the game. Avoiding snowball , making the most balanced matches . <br>
		
		Do not use ofencivos names only name that indicate whether help is very necessary. <br>
		
		I have 10 friends tested the app is the results are good ... it is possible to provide for a stomp, and prevent it from happening . <br>
